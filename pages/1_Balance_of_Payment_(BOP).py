            Statistics on the Balance of Payments (BOP) and Inward Direct Investment Flows (FDI Inflows) are gathered by the Singapore Department of Statistics.
            The BOP provides a summary of economic transactions between the residents of Singapore and those of other countries. Singaporeâ€™s FDI inflows capture the 
            net value of investments made by foreign direct investors in local enterprises, accounting for both increases and decreases in investment over a specified period.
