            <h3>Hypothesis ðŸ¤”</h3>
            <p>We hypothesize that changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) significantly influence the Balance of Payments (BOP) and, consequently, Aggregate Demand (AD).
            Specifically, we aim to explore how inflation (as measured by CPI) impacts the trade balance, investment flows, and overall economic stability.</p>

            CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. It is a key indicator of inflation

            <p>The <b>current account</b> of the BOP directly relates to the net exports component (X - M) of AD. Changes in net exports affect AD because net exports are part of the AD formula: <b>AD = C + I + G + (X - M)</b>. Inflation (CPI) influences both AD components and BOP components. For instance, higher inflation can reduce exports and increase imports, impacting the current account balance and thus affecting AD.</p></p>
